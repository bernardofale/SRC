Data Exploration: 
Start by exploring and visualizing the data to get an overall understanding of its distribution, range, and patterns. 
Plot histograms, line charts, scatter plots, or any other suitable visualization techniques to examine the distributions and relationships 
between different variables.

Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis on the relevant columns to extract key descriptive statistics. 
This includes measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, minimum, maximum, quartiles, and percentiles. 
These statistics provide insights into the central tendencies, variability, and distribution of the data.

Temporal Analysis: Analyze the timestamp column to identify any temporal patterns or trends. 
Calculate metrics such as the frequency of events over time, hourly or daily patterns, or the occurrence of events during specific time intervals. 
This analysis can help identify normal patterns of network activity and detect deviations from those patterns.

IP Address Analysis: Analyze the src_ip and dst_ip columns to identify common IP addresses, top communication partners, or IP address ranges. 
Look for any unusual or infrequently occurring IP addresses that may indicate anomalous behavior. 
You can also perform geolocation analysis to understand the geographic distribution of the IP addresses involved.

Protocol and Port Analysis: Analyze the proto and port columns to identify the most frequently used protocols and ports in the network traffic. 
Determine the distribution of protocols and ports and identify any outliers or uncommon values that may require further investigation.

Bytes Analysis: Examine the up_bytes and down_bytes columns to understand the volume of data transferred in each direction. Calculate 
statistics such as the average, maximum, or minimum bytes transferred per session or over a specific time period. 
This analysis can help identify typical data transfer patterns and identify any unusually large or small values.

Correlation Analysis: Explore the relationships between different columns to identify any correlations or dependencies. 
For example, you can calculate correlation coefficients between up_bytes and down_bytes or investigate how different protocols or ports are 
associated with certain IP addresses. This analysis can provide insights into normal patterns of network communication.

Baseline Creation: Establish a baseline or reference model of non-anomalous behavior based on the analysis performed. This baseline represents the
typical behavior of the network data, and any deviations from it can be considered potentially anomalous or suspicious. 
The baseline can be used for future anomaly detection and comparison purposes.
